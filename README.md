**fswatch** is a developer tool that triggers commands in response to filesystem changes.
Works well on Mac, Linux, and should also works on Windows(not well tested).

## Install
```
go get -u -v github.com/codeskyblue/fswatch
```

## Quick start
### Step 1
Create a config file `.fsw.yml`, quickly generated by the following command.

	fswatch init

config file example

```yaml
desc: Auto generated by fswatch [fswatch]
triggers:
- patterns:
  - '**/*.go'
  - '**/*.c'
  # also support '!**/test_*.go'
  env:
    DEBUG: "1"
  # if shell is true, $cmd will be wrapped with `bash -c`
  shell: true
  cmd: go test -v
  delay: 100ms
  stop_timeout:1s
  signal: "KILL"
  kill_signal: "SIGTERM"
watch_paths:
- .
watch_depth: 5
```

### Step 2
Run `fswatch` directly.
Every time you edit a file. Command `go test -v` will be called.

```
$ fswatch
fswatch >>> exec start: go test -v
# github.com/codeskyblue/fswatch
./fswatch.go:281: main redeclared in this block
	previous declaration at ./config.go:354
fswatch >>> program exited: exit status 2
fswatch >>> finish in 145.499911ms
```



## You should know
### How fswatch kill process
fswatch send signal to all process when restart. (mac and linux killed by pgid, windows by taskkill)
`Ctrl+C` will trigger fswatch quit and kill all process it started.

### Patterns
More about the patterns. The pattern has the same rule like `.gitignore`.
So you can write like this.

```
- patterns:
  - '*.go'
  - '!*_test.go'
  - '!**/bindata.go'
```

`main.go` changed will trigger command, but `a_test.go` and `libs/bindata.go` will be ignored.

## FAQs
`too many open files`

For mac, run the following command

    sysctl -w kern.maxfiles=20480
    sysctl -w kern.maxfilesperproc=18000
    ulimit -S -n 2048

## Code History
I reviewed the first version of fswatch(which was taged 0.1). The code I look now is shit. So I deleted almost 80% code, And left some very useful functions.
